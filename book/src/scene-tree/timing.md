# Scene Tree Initialization and Timing

The godot-bevy library automatically parses the Godot scene tree and creates corresponding Bevy entities before your game logic runs. This means you can safely query for scene entities in your `Startup` systems:

```rust
#[bevy_app]
fn build_app(app: &mut App) {
    app.add_systems(Startup, find_player);
}

fn find_player(query: Query<&PlayerBundle>) {
    // Your player entity will be here! âœ¨
    for player in &query {
        println!("Found the player!");
    }
}
```

## How It Works

The scene tree initialization happens in the `PreStartup` schedule, ensuring entities are ready before any `Startup` systems run. This process has two parallel systems:

1. **`initialize_scene_tree`** - Traverses the entire Godot scene tree and creates Bevy entities with components like `GodotNodeHandle`, `Name`, transforms, and more
2. **`connect_scene_tree`** - Sets up event listeners for runtime scene changes (nodes being added, removed, or renamed)

Both systems run in parallel during `PreStartup`, and both complete before your `Startup` systems run. This means you can safely query for Godot scene entities in `Startup`!

## Runtime Scene Updates

After the initial parse, the library continues to listen for scene tree changes during runtime. This is handled by two systems that run in the `First` schedule:

- **`write_scene_tree_events`** - Receives events from Godot (via an mpsc channel) and writes them to Bevy's event system
- **`read_scene_tree_events`** - Processes those events to create/update/remove entities

This separation allows other systems to also react to `SceneTreeEvent`s if needed.

## What Components Are Available?

When the scene tree is parsed, each Godot node becomes a Bevy entity with these components:

- **`GodotNodeHandle`** - Reference to the Godot node
- **`Name`** - The node's name from Godot
- **`Transform2D`** or **`Transform3D`** - For Node2D and Node3D types respectively
- **`Groups`** - The node's group memberships
- **`Collisions`** - If the node has collision signals
- **Node type markers** - Components like `ButtonMarker`, `Sprite2DMarker`, etc.
- **Custom bundles** - Components from `#[derive(BevyBundle)]` are automatically added

## BevyBundle Component Timing

If you've defined custom Godot node types with `#[derive(BevyBundle)]`, their components are added **immediately** during scene tree processing. This happens:

- **During `PreStartup`** for nodes that exist when the scene is first loaded
- **During `First`** for nodes added dynamically at runtime

This means BevyBundle components are available in `Startup` systems for initial scene nodes, and immediately available for dynamically added nodes.

```rust
#[derive(GodotClass, BevyBundle)]
#[class(base=Node2D)]
#[bevy_bundle((Health), (Velocity))]
pub struct Player {
    base: Base<Node2D>,
}

// This will work in Startup - the Health and Velocity components
// are automatically added during PreStartup for existing nodes
fn setup_player(mut query: Query<(Entity, &Health, &Velocity)>) {
    for (entity, health, velocity) in &mut query {
        // Player components are guaranteed to be here!
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use `Startup` for initialization** - Scene entities are guaranteed to be ready
2. **Use `Update` for gameplay logic** - This is where most of your game code should live
3. **Custom `PreStartup` systems** - If you add systems to `PreStartup`, be aware they run before scene parsing unless you explicitly order them with `.after()`

## Understanding the Event Flow

Here's what happens when a node is added to the scene tree during runtime:

1. Godot emits a `node_added` signal
2. The `SceneTreeWatcher` (on the Godot side) receives the signal
3. It sends a `SceneTreeEvent` through an mpsc channel
4. `write_scene_tree_events` (in `First` schedule) reads from the channel and writes to Bevy's event system
5. `read_scene_tree_events` (also in `First` schedule) processes the event and creates/updates entities

This architecture allows for flexible event handling while maintaining a clean separation between Godot and Bevy.
