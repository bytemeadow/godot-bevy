# Migration Guide: v0.6 to v0.7

This guide covers breaking changes and new features when upgrading from godot-bevy 0.6.x to 0.7.0.

## Node Type Markers (New Feature)

### What Changed

Starting in v0.7.0, all entities representing Godot nodes automatically receive **marker components** that indicate their node type. This enables type-safe, efficient ECS queries without runtime type checking.

### Migration Path

This change is **backwards compatible** - your existing code will continue to work. However, you can improve performance and safety by migrating to marker-based queries.

#### Before (v0.6.x approach - still works)

```rust
use godot_bevy::prelude::*;

fn update_sprites(mut all_nodes: Query<&mut GodotNodeHandle>) {
    for mut handle in all_nodes.iter_mut() {
        // Runtime type checking - works but inefficient
        if let Some(sprite) = handle.try_get::<Sprite2D>() {
            sprite.set_modulate(Color::RED);
        }
    }
}

fn update_character_bodies(mut all_nodes: Query<&mut GodotNodeHandle>) {
    for mut handle in all_nodes.iter_mut() {
        // Check every single entity in your scene
        if let Some(mut body) = handle.try_get::<CharacterBody2D>() {
            body.move_and_slide();
        }
    }
}
```

#### After (v0.7.0 recommended approach)

```rust
use godot_bevy::prelude::*;

fn update_sprites(mut sprites: Query<&mut GodotNodeHandle, With<Sprite2DMarker>>) {
    for mut handle in sprites.iter_mut() {
        // ECS pre-filters to only Sprite2D entities - much faster!
        let sprite = handle.get::<Sprite2D>(); // No Option<> - guaranteed to work
        sprite.set_modulate(Color::RED);
    }
}

fn update_character_bodies(mut bodies: Query<&mut GodotNodeHandle, With<CharacterBody2DMarker>>) {
    for mut handle in bodies.iter_mut() {
        // Only iterates over CharacterBody2D entities
        let mut body = handle.get::<CharacterBody2D>();
        body.move_and_slide();
    }
}
```

### Benefits of Migration

1. **Performance**: Only iterate over entities you care about
2. **Safety**: No more `Option<>` handling or potential panics
3. **Clarity**: Query signatures clearly show what node types you expect
4. **Optimization**: Better ECS query optimization and caching

### Common Migration Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Single Node Type

**Before:**
```rust
fn system(mut all_nodes: Query<&mut GodotNodeHandle>) {
    for mut handle in all_nodes.iter_mut() {
        if let Some(mut timer) = handle.try_get::<Timer>() {
            if timer.is_stopped() {
                timer.start();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**After:**
```rust
fn system(mut timers: Query<&mut GodotNodeHandle, With<TimerMarker>>) {
    for mut handle in timers.iter_mut() {
        let mut timer = handle.get::<Timer>();
        if timer.is_stopped() {
            timer.start();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Pattern 2: Multiple Node Types

**Before:**
```rust
fn audio_system(mut all_nodes: Query<&mut GodotNodeHandle>) {
    for mut handle in all_nodes.iter_mut() {
        if let Some(mut player) = handle.try_get::<AudioStreamPlayer>() {
            player.set_volume_db(-10.0);
        } else if let Some(mut player_2d) = handle.try_get::<AudioStreamPlayer2D>() {
            player_2d.set_volume_db(-10.0);
        } else if let Some(mut player_3d) = handle.try_get::<AudioStreamPlayer3D>() {
            player_3d.set_volume_db(-10.0);
        }
    }
}
```

**After:**
```rust
fn audio_system(
    mut players_1d: Query<&mut GodotNodeHandle, With<AudioStreamPlayerMarker>>,
    mut players_2d: Query<&mut GodotNodeHandle, With<AudioStreamPlayer2DMarker>>,
    mut players_3d: Query<&mut GodotNodeHandle, With<AudioStreamPlayer3DMarker>>,
) {
    // Process each type separately - much more efficient!
    for mut handle in players_1d.iter_mut() {
        let mut player = handle.get::<AudioStreamPlayer>();
        player.set_volume_db(-10.0);
    }
    
    for mut handle in players_2d.iter_mut() {
        let mut player = handle.get::<AudioStreamPlayer2D>();
        player.set_volume_db(-10.0);
    }
    
    for mut handle in players_3d.iter_mut() {
        let mut player = handle.get::<AudioStreamPlayer3D>();
        player.set_volume_db(-10.0);
    }
}
```

#### Pattern 3: Complex Conditions

**Before:**
```rust
fn physics_sprites(mut all_nodes: Query<&mut GodotNodeHandle>) {
    for mut handle in all_nodes.iter_mut() {
        if let Some(sprite) = handle.try_get::<Sprite2D>() {
            if let Some(body) = handle.try_get::<RigidBody2D>() {
                // Entity has both Sprite2D and RigidBody2D
                handle_physics_sprite(sprite, body);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**After:**
```rust
fn physics_sprites(
    mut entities: Query<&mut GodotNodeHandle, (With<Sprite2DMarker>, With<RigidBody2DMarker>)>
) {
    for mut handle in entities.iter_mut() {
        // ECS guarantees both components exist
        let sprite = handle.get::<Sprite2D>();
        let body = handle.get::<RigidBody2D>();
        handle_physics_sprite(sprite, body);
    }
}
```

## Available Marker Components

All marker components are available in the prelude:

```rust
use godot_bevy::prelude::*;

// Examples of available markers:
// Sprite2DMarker, CharacterBody2DMarker, Area2DMarker, 
// AudioStreamPlayerMarker, LabelMarker, ButtonMarker,
// Camera2DMarker, RigidBody2DMarker, etc.
```

See the [complete list of markers](../scene-tree/querying.md#available-marker-components) in the querying documentation.

## Performance Impact

Marker-based queries provide several performance advantages:

- **Reduced iteration**: Only process entities that match your node type, rather than checking every entity in the scene
- **Eliminated runtime type checking**: Skip `try_get()` calls since the ECS guarantees type matches
- **Better cache locality**: Process similar entities together rather than jumping between different node types
- **ECS optimization**: Bevy can better optimize queries when it knows the component filters upfront

The actual performance improvement will depend on your scene size and how many entities match your queries, but the benefits are most noticeable in systems that run frequently (like every frame) and in larger scenes.

## When NOT to Migrate

You might want to keep the old approach if:

1. **Rare usage**: The system runs infrequently and performance isn't critical
2. **Dynamic typing**: You genuinely need to handle unknown node types at runtime
3. **Gradual migration**: You're updating a large codebase incrementally

The old `try_get()` patterns will continue to work indefinitely.

## Troubleshooting

### "Entity doesn't have expected component"

If you get panics when using `.get()` instead of `.try_get()`, it usually means:

1. **Wrong marker**: Make sure you're using the right marker for your query
2. **Node freed**: The Godot node was freed but the entity still exists
3. **Timing issue**: The node was removed between query execution and access

**Solution**: Use marker-based queries to ensure type safety, or fall back to `.try_get()` if needed.

### "Query doesn't match any entities"

If your marker-based query returns no entities:

1. **Check node types**: Verify your scene has the expected node types
2. **Check marker names**: Ensure you're using the correct marker component
3. **Check timing**: Make sure the scene tree has been processed

**Solution**: Use `Query<&GodotNodeHandle, With<NodeMarker>>` to see all entities, then check what markers they have.

## Summary

The node type markers feature in v0.7.0 provides a significant upgrade to querying performance and type safety. While migration is optional, it's highly recommended for any systems that process specific Godot node types frequently.

The migration path is straightforward:
1. Replace broad `Query<&mut GodotNodeHandle>` with specific marker queries
2. Replace `try_get()` calls with `get()` when using markers  
3. Handle multiple node types with separate queries rather than runtime checks

This results in cleaner, faster, and safer code while maintaining the flexibility of the ECS architecture.

## BevyBundle Autosync Simplification

### What Changed

In v0.7.0, the `autosync` parameter has been **removed** from `#[derive(BevyBundle)]`. All BevyBundle derives now automatically register their bundles and apply them during scene tree processing.

### Migration Path

This change requires minimal code changes but may affect your app architecture if you were manually managing bundle systems.

#### Before (v0.6.x)

```rust
// Manual autosync control
#[derive(GodotClass, BevyBundle)]
#[class(base=Node2D)]
#[bevy_bundle((Health), (Velocity), autosync=true)]  // ← autosync parameter
pub struct Player {
    base: Base<Node2D>,
}

// Alternative: manually registering the system
#[derive(GodotClass, BevyBundle)]
#[class(base=Node2D)]
#[bevy_bundle((Health), (Velocity))]  // ← autosync=false (default)
pub struct Enemy {
    base: Base<Node2D>,
}

#[bevy_app]
fn build_app(app: &mut App) {
    // Had to manually add the sync system
    app.add_systems(Update, EnemyAutoSyncPlugin);
}
```

#### After (v0.7.0)

```rust
// Automatic registration - much simpler!
#[derive(GodotClass, BevyBundle)]
#[class(base=Node2D)]
#[bevy_bundle((Health), (Velocity))]  // ← No autosync parameter needed
pub struct Player {
    base: Base<Node2D>,
}

#[derive(GodotClass, BevyBundle)]
#[class(base=Node2D)]
#[bevy_bundle((Health), (Velocity))]  // ← Always automatic now
pub struct Enemy {
    base: Base<Node2D>,
}

#[bevy_app]
fn build_app(app: &mut App) {
    // No manual system registration needed!
    // Bundles are automatically applied during scene tree processing
}
```

### Breaking Changes

1. **Remove `autosync=true`**: This parameter no longer exists and will cause compilation errors
2. **Remove manual sync systems**: If you were manually adding bundle sync systems, remove them
3. **Timing change**: Bundle components are now available in `Startup` systems (was previously only available in `Update`)

### Benefits of This Change

1. **Simplified API**: No need to remember to set `autosync=true`
2. **Better timing**: Bundle components are available earlier in the frame lifecycle
3. **Unified behavior**: Both initial scene loading and dynamic node addition work the same way
4. **No missed registrations**: Impossible to forget to register a bundle system

### Migration Checklist

- [ ] Remove `autosync=true` and `autosync=false` from all `#[bevy_bundle()]` attributes
- [ ] Remove any manually registered bundle sync systems from your app
- [ ] Test that bundle components are available in `Startup` systems (they now are!)
- [ ] Update any documentation or comments that reference the old autosync behavior

### Example Migration

**Before (v0.6.x):**
```rust
#[derive(GodotClass, BevyBundle)]
#[class(base=CharacterBody2D)]
#[bevy_bundle((Speed: speed), (Health: max_health), autosync=true)]
pub struct Player {
    base: Base<CharacterBody2D>,
    #[export] speed: f32,
    #[export] max_health: f32,
}

#[bevy_app]
fn build_app(app: &mut App) {
    app.add_systems(Startup, setup_game)
       .add_systems(Update, player_movement);
}

fn setup_game(players: Query<&Health>) {
    // This would be empty in v0.6.x because bundles
    // weren't applied until the first Update
    println!("Found {} players", players.iter().count());
}
```

**After (v0.7.0):**
```rust
#[derive(GodotClass, BevyBundle)]
#[class(base=CharacterBody2D)]
#[bevy_bundle((Speed: speed), (Health: max_health))]  // ← Removed autosync
pub struct Player {
    base: Base<CharacterBody2D>,
    #[export] speed: f32,
    #[export] max_health: f32,
}

#[bevy_app]
fn build_app(app: &mut App) {
    app.add_systems(Startup, setup_game)
       .add_systems(Update, player_movement);
}

fn setup_game(players: Query<&Health>) {
    // This now works in Startup! Bundle components are available immediately
    println!("Found {} players", players.iter().count());
}
```

This change makes BevyBundle usage more intuitive and eliminates a common source of timing-related bugs.
