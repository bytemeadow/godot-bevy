## Godot Bevy now uses standard Bevy Transforms (Breaking Change)

### What Changed

In v.0.9.0, we've made significant changes to how we use bevy `Transform` components. We now operate directly on standard
`Transform` components and you can too, whereas before, we had wrapped the `Transform` component in higher level
`Transform2D` and `Transform3D` components and required you to use the wrappers. While wrapping provided important
benefits (change detection, dual-godot/bevy-API access with built-in multi-threaded safety) it came with some notable
drawbacks (incompatible with other bevy ecosystem plugins that operate directly on `Transform`s, extra memory overhead,
less ergonomic as it required extra API calls to access the underlying data).

### Migration Path

The main change is switching all of your usages of `godot_bevy::prelude::Transform2D` or
`godot_bevy::prelude::Transform3D` to `bevy::transform::components::Transform`.

#### Before (v.0.9.0)

```rust
fn orbit_system(
    // The `transform` parameter is a Bevy `Query` that matches all `Transform2D` components.
    // `Transform2D` is a Godot-Bevy-provided component that matches all Node2Ds in the scene.
    // (https://docs.rs/godot-bevy/latest/godot_bevy/plugins/core/transforms/struct.Transform2D.html)
    mut transform: Query<(&mut Transform2D, &InitialPosition, &mut Orbiter)>,

    // This is equivalent to Godot's `_process` `delta: float` parameter.
    process_delta: Res<Time>,
) {
    // For single matches, you can use `single_mut()` instead:
    // `if let Ok(mut transform) = transform.single_mut() {`
    for (mut transform, initial_position, mut orbiter) in transform.iter_mut() {
        transform.as_godot_mut().origin =
            initial_position.pos + Vector2::from_angle(orbiter.angle) * 100.0;
        orbiter.angle += process_delta.as_ref().delta_secs();
        orbiter.angle %= 2.0 * PI;
    }
}
```

#### After (v.0.9.0)

```rust
fn orbit_system(
    // The `transform` parameter is a Bevy `Query` that matches all `Transform` components.
    // `Transform` is a Godot-Bevy-provided component that matches all Node2Ds in the scene.
    // (https://docs.rs/godot-bevy/latest/godot_bevy/plugins/core/transforms/struct.Transform.html)
    mut transform: Query<(&mut Transform, &InitialPosition, &mut Orbiter)>,

    // This is equivalent to Godot's `_process` `delta: float` parameter.
    process_delta: Res<Time>,
) {
    // For single matches, you can use `single_mut()` instead:
    // `if let Ok(mut transform) = transform.single_mut() {`
    for (mut transform, initial_position, mut orbiter) in transform.iter_mut() {
        let position2d = initial_position.pos + Vector2::from_angle(orbiter.angle) * 100.0;
        transform.translation.x = position2d.x;
        transform.translation.y = position2d.y;
        orbiter.angle += process_delta.as_ref().delta_secs();
        orbiter.angle %= 2.0 * PI;
    }
}
```

### Breaking changes

- `godot_bevy::prelude::Transform2D` and `godot_bevy::prelude::Transform3D` were removed

### Migration Checklist

- [ ] **Transform components changed**: Replaced `godot_bevy::prelude::Transform2D` and `godot_bevy::prelude::Transform3D`
      with `bevy::transform::components::Transform`. The APIs from the former must be mapped to the latter:
  - [ ] Remove the now extra `as_bevy()` and `as_bevy_mut()` calls, since you're operating directly on bevy
        Transforms, e.g., `transform.as_bevy_mut().translation.x` -> `transform.translation.x`. These changes should be
        easy.
  - [ ] Remap the `as_godot()` and `as_godot_mut()` calls. These changes may be tricky, as there may not be direct
        replacements for all Godot APIs in native Bevy transforms. One important benefit of doing this work is that it
        promotes a clean separation where your bevy transform systems remain portable to other Bevy projects (with or
        without godot-bevy). You can always fall back on using GodotNodeHandle to get at the original Godot Node APIs, then
        replicate position, scale, and rotation back to the bevy Transform as necessary.

## Scene Tree Plugin Configuration Simplified

### What Changed

The `add_transforms` configuration option has been removed from `GodotSceneTreePlugin`. Transform components are now automatically added to scene tree entities when the `GodotTransformSyncPlugin` is included in your app.

### Migration Path

If you were using the `add_transforms` configuration option, you can simply remove it. Transform components will be automatically added if you include the transform plugin.

#### Before (v0.8.x)

```rust
app.add_plugins(GodotSceneTreePlugin {
    add_transforms: true,
    add_child_relationship: true,
});
```

#### After (v0.9.0)

```rust
// Transform components are automatically added when GodotTransformSyncPlugin is included
app.add_plugins(GodotSceneTreePlugin {
    add_child_relationship: true,
});

// Add the transform plugin to get automatic transform components
app.add_plugins(GodotTransformSyncPlugin::default());
```
