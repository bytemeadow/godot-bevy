# godot-bevy

`godot-bevy` is a Rust library that brings [Bevy's](https://bevyengine.org/) powerful Entity Component System (ECS) to the versatile [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/). Use Bevy's ergonomic and high-performance Rust ECS within your Godot projects to get the best of both worlds.

## Recommended Workflow

**godot-bevy is a library for Godot developers who want to leverage Bevy's powerful ECS system within their Godot projects.** This is not a Godot plugin for Bevy users, but rather a way to bring the best of both worlds together with Godot as the foundation.

We encourage a **Godot-first approach** where you:

- **Design scenes and nodes in Godot** - Use Godot's excellent scene editor, node system, and visual tools for level design, UI, and content creation
- **Manage assets in Godot** - Import textures, audio, 3D models, and configure them using Godot's import system and project settings  
- **Use Bevy ECS for logic** - Write your game systems, components, and logic using Bevy's high-performance, data-oriented ECS
- **Consume Godot resources from ECS** - Load and use Godot-managed assets seamlessly within your Bevy systems

This approach gives you the **visual authoring power of Godot** combined with the **performance and architectural benefits of Bevy's ECS**, while maintaining a single source of truth for your game's content and configuration.

The library handles all the complex bridging between these two paradigms, so you can focus on building your game rather than managing integration details.

## Quick Start

### Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
godot-bevy = "0.4.0"
bevy = { version = "0.16.0", default-features = false }
godot = "0.2.4"
```

### Basic Usage

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;
use godot_bevy::prelude::*;

#[bevy_app]
fn build_app(app: &mut App) {
    app.add_systems(Update, handle_button_clicks)
        .add_systems(PhysicsUpdate, move_player);
}

// React to Godot UI signals in your ECS
fn handle_button_clicks(mut events: EventReader<GodotSignal>) {
    for signal in events.read() {
        if signal.name == "pressed" {
            println!("Button clicked! Entity: {:?}", signal.origin);
        }
    }
}

// Move player with physics timing
fn move_player(
    mut player: Query<(&Player, &mut Transform2D)>,
    mut system_delta: SystemDeltaTimer,
) {
    if let Ok((player_data, mut transform)) = player.single_mut() {
        let mut velocity = Vector2::ZERO;
        
        if Input::singleton().is_action_pressed("move_right") {
            velocity.x += 1.0;
        }
        if Input::singleton().is_action_pressed("move_left") {
            velocity.x -= 1.0;
        }
        
        if velocity.length() > 0.0 {
            velocity = velocity.normalized() * player_data.speed;
            transform.origin += velocity * system_delta.delta_seconds();
        }
    }
}
```

### Node Queries

One of godot-bevy's most powerful features is the ability to **query and interact with Godot nodes directly through Bevy's ECS**. Every Godot node becomes a Bevy entity that you can query, modify, and control.

#### Querying

```rust
use godot::classes::{Label, Button, Area2D, Node2D};
use godot_bevy::prelude::*;

// Query nodes with your custom components, then cast to specific Godot types
fn update_player_ui(
    mut player: Query<&mut GodotNodeHandle, With<Player>>,
    player_health: Query<&Health, With<Player>>,
) -> Result {
    if let (Ok(mut player_handle), Ok(health)) = (player.single_mut(), player_health.get_single()) {
        // Cast the handle to your custom Godot class
        let player_node = player_handle.get::<MyPlayerNode>();
        
        // Or cast to built-in Godot classes
        let area2d = player_handle.get::<Area2D>();
        let overlapping_bodies = area2d.get_overlapping_bodies().len();
        
        if overlapping_bodies > 0 {
            println!("Player is colliding with {} bodies", overlapping_bodies);
        }
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

#### Working with Node Groups and Entity Queries

```rust
// Query entities and check Godot node groups
fn handle_enemy_groups(
    mut commands: Commands, 
    entities: Query<(Entity, &mut GodotNodeHandle)>
) -> Result {
    for (entity, mut node_handle) in entities.iter() {
        let node = node_handle.get::<Node>();
        
        // Check if node is in a specific Godot group
        if node.is_in_group("enemies".into()) {
            // Add ECS components based on node groups
            commands.entity(entity).insert(Enemy { health: 100 });
        }
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

#### Finding Nodes by Name

```rust
// Use a helper trait to find entities by node name
fn setup_start_position(
    mut player: Query<&mut Transform2D, With<Player>>,
    entities: Query<(&Name, &mut GodotNodeHandle)>,
) -> Result {
    if let Ok(mut transform) = player.single_mut() {
        // Find the start position node by name
        let start_pos_handle = entities
            .iter()
            .find_entity_by_name("StartPosition")
            .unwrap();
            
        let start_node = start_pos_handle.get::<Node2D>();
        let position = start_node.get_position();
        
        // Set player position from Godot node
        transform.as_godot_mut().origin = position;
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Asset Management

**The library provides unified asset loading that works consistently in both development and exported games**. While Godot packages assets differently when exporting (filesystem vs .pck files), `godot-bevy` abstracts this complexity away.

#### Quick Start

Use Bevy's `AssetServer`  for modern, non-blocking asset loading:

```rust
use bevy::asset::{AssetServer, Assets, Handle};
use godot_bevy::prelude::*;

fn load_assets(asset_server: Res<AssetServer>) {
    // Load any Godot resource through Bevy's asset system (async, non-blocking)
    let scene: Handle<GodotResource> = asset_server.load("scenes/player.tscn");
    let audio: Handle<GodotResource> = asset_server.load("audio/music.ogg");
    let texture: Handle<GodotResource> = asset_server.load("art/player.png");
    
    // Works with bevy_asset_loader for loading states
}

fn use_loaded_assets(
    mut assets: ResMut<Assets<GodotResource>>,
    scene_handle: Handle<GodotResource>, // Your loaded handle
) {
    if let Some(asset) = assets.get_mut(&scene_handle) {
        // Cast to specific Godot types as needed
        if let Some(scene) = asset.try_cast::<PackedScene>() {
            // Use the scene...
        }
        if let Some(audio) = asset.try_cast::<AudioStream>() {
            // Use the audio...
        }
    }
}
```

### Audio System

The library provides a convenient audio API using Godot's audio engine

#### Quick Start

**AssetCollection Loading** (recommended):
```rust
#[derive(AssetCollection, Resource)]
struct GameAudio {
    #[asset(path = "audio/background.ogg")]
    background_music: Handle<GodotResource>,
    #[asset(path = "audio/gameover.wav")]
    death_sound: Handle<GodotResource>,
}

// Add to your loading state
app.add_loading_state(
    LoadingState::new(GameState::Loading)
        .continue_to_state(GameState::Menu)
        .load_collection::<GameAudio>()
);
```

**Direct AssetServer Loading**:
```rust
fn load_audio_on_demand(asset_server: Res<AssetServer>) {
    let music: Handle<GodotResource> = asset_server.load("audio/battle.ogg");
    // Store handle somewhere for later use
}
```

## Inspiration and Acknowledgements

This library is inspired by and builds upon the work of [bevy_godot](https://github.com/rand0m-cloud/bevy_godot), which provided similar functionality for Godot 3. `godot-bevy` extends this concept to support Godot 4 and Bevy 0.16.
