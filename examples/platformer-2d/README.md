# Platformer 2D Example

This example demonstrates a simple platformer game using the Godot game engine where all scenes are configured in editor. It showcases basic physics, collision detection, player movement, scene switching, audio playback and adding bundles to custom Godot nodes for tagging even when nodes are configured in editor.

## Features

- Basic physics simulation
- Collision detection and response
- Player movement controls
- Scene switching between levels
- Audio playback for sound effects and music
- Adding bundles to custom Godot nodes for tagging even when nodes are configured in editor
