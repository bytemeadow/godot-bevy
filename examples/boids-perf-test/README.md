# Boids Performance Benchmark

This example demonstrates the performance benefits of using **godot-bevy** (Rust + ECS) compared to pure Godot (GDScript) for computationally intensive tasks like boids simulation.

> ðŸš€ **Key Performance Benefits**: This benchmark shows **2x better performance** with godot-bevy at 2000 boids (~39 FPS vs ~18 FPS), with the performance gap increasing significantly as entity counts scale up.

## What This Benchmark Tests

### Pure Godot Implementation (GDScript)
- **Language**: GDScript
- **Architecture**: Traditional object-oriented approach with Node2D instances
- **Neighbor Finding**: Spatial grid optimization
- **Behaviors**: Separation, alignment, cohesion, boundary avoidance
- **Limitations**: Single-threaded, interpreted language overhead

### godot-bevy Implementation (Rust + ECS)
- **Language**: Rust (compiled, zero-cost abstractions)
- **Architecture**: Entity Component System with Bevy
- **Neighbor Finding**: **bevy_spatial KDTree2** with k_nearest_neighbour optimization
- **Transform Sync**: **Hybrid batching** for efficient Transform2D synchronization
- **Behaviors**: Separation, alignment, cohesion, boundary avoidance
- **Visual Effects**: **Random color generation** matching GDScript variety
- **Advantages**: Compiled performance, memory efficiency, CPU cache-friendly data layout

## Boids Algorithm

Both implementations use the classic boids algorithm with four behaviors:

1. **Separation**: Avoid crowding neighbors
2. **Alignment**: Steer towards average heading of neighbors  
3. **Cohesion**: Move towards center of mass of neighbors
4. **Boundary Avoidance**: Steer away from world edges (both use 100px margin with 2x force strength)

**Boundary Handling**: Both implementations also use wraparound boundaries as a fallback - if a boid still reaches an edge despite avoidance forces, it wraps to the opposite side (toroidal world).

### Performance-Critical Operations

- **Neighbor Finding**: Spatial grid (75x75px cells) vs **bevy_spatial KDTree2** with k_nearest_neighbour
- **Transform Synchronization**: Batch vs individual Godot scene updates
- **Vector Math**: Hundreds of vector calculations per frame
- **Memory Access**: Cache efficiency becomes critical with many entities
- **Update Loops**: Processing thousands of entities each frame

## Running the Benchmark

### Prerequisites

1. **Rust toolchain** (for compiling the godot-bevy implementation)
2. **Godot 4.2+** 
3. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   cd rust
   cargo build --release
   ```

- **Current FPS**: Real-time frame rate
- **Average FPS**: Rolling average over 5 seconds
- **Min/Max FPS**: Performance extremes
- **Active Boids**: Current entity count

## Expected Results

### Performance Characteristics

| Boid Count | Godot (GDScript) | godot-bevy (Rust) | Improvement |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 100        | ~60 FPS          | ~60 FPS           | Minimal     |
| 500        | ~50 FPS          | ~60 FPS           | 1.2x        |
| 1000       | ~35 FPS          | ~55 FPS           | 1.6x        |
| **2000**   | **~18 FPS**      | **~39 FPS**       | **2.2x**    |

> **Note**: Actual results measured on M1 MacBook Pro. The **Rust implementation is 13.4x faster** in pure algorithm execution (0.38ms vs 22.4ms force calculation), with the remaining time spent on transform synchronization and rendering.

### Why godot-bevy Performs Better

1. **Different Spatial Structures**: **bevy_spatial KDTree2** with k_nearest_neighbour (50-entity cap) vs spatial grid (75x75px cells)
2. **Compiled vs Interpreted**: Rust compiles to native machine code, GDScript is interpreted  
3. **Memory Layout**: ECS components are stored contiguously in memory (cache-friendly)
4. **Efficient Transform Sync**: **Hybrid batching** reduces Godot API call overhead
5. **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Rust's ownership system eliminates garbage collection overhead
6. **SIMD Optimizations**: Rust compiler can auto-vectorize mathematical operations

4. **Same Update Rate**: Both update at consistent intervals using native scheduling
5. **Identical Parameters**: Same max_speed, max_force, perception_radius, separation_radius, boundary_weight

## Conclusion

This benchmark demonstrates that **godot-bevy provides significant performance benefits** for CPU-intensive game logic, particularly as complexity scales. While Godot excels at game editor features and rapid prototyping, godot-bevy offers the performance characteristics needed for demanding simulations, large-scale multiplayer games, and complex AI systems.

The performance gap becomes most apparent with:
- **High entity counts** (1000+ objects)
- **Complex per-entity calculations** (physics, AI, pathfinding)
- **Frequent data access patterns** (neighbor queries, spatial partitioning)

For games requiring maximum performance in these areas, godot-bevy provides a compelling solution that combines Godot's excellent tooling with Rust's performance characteristics.
